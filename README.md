# Airbnb Data Analysis

### Summary/Motivation and Dataset:

In this project, I will investigate the Airbnb ratings dataset (http://www.kaggle.com/samyukthamurali/airbnb-ratings-dataset) which I found on Kaggle. 
The datasets are available to download in CSV format. The overarching goal is to determine the attributes that are the most influential 
to the prices of listings of the Airbnbs in the U.S.. The original dataset contains three sub-datasets: LA_Listings, NY_Listings, and 
airbnb_ratings_new. The three datasets contain 59.9k instances and 35 attributes, including customer ID, host ID, locations, layouts, 
furnishings, prices of the residences, review scores, etc. I will be merging all the three datasets by just appending them to each other 
as they contain the exact same column types. In addition, my analyses include price variation based on various features and to help hosts 
determine which area is best suited for generating higher revenues.


### 8 Analyses:

1.The agenda is to find the variable with highest correlation with price. 
I will plot a pair plot of selected columns to find correlation of price of the various Airbnb’s and other factors such as bedrooms,
bathrooms, review scores value, reviews per month and review scores accuracy. In addition, I will perform spearman correlation test 
on the data to confirm the correlation of price with one other variable having highest correlation.

2.I will group the properties based on property type to calculate the mean price for each property type. The aim will be to find the 
most expensive property type by plotting a histogram to observe the same.

3.Calculate the estimated revenue generated for each listing ID by multiplying the price of a property with the minimum nights column. 
What areas are best for bringing in the most money and can be recommended to potential hosts?

4.Plot a bar plot to depict the distribution of the busiest months in terms of number of bookings by months and total estimated revenues 
generated by the hosts of various properties by months.

5.I will filter the dataset to capture an image of the larger rentals which would be the ones having above average number of bathrooms,
can accommodate more than the mean number of people, and have above average number of bedrooms. I will calculate the 5 summary statistics 
for each of the three columns indicating larger rentals for each state to see whether the larger rentals have more reviews. This would be 
plotted as a boxplot using ggplot.

6.Plot a violin plot (or box plot) to see how price changes based on the number of accommodates and see if there is any correlation between 
the two.

7.Analyze and plot the number of listings based on their property type to see whether people’s preferences of renting an apartment, 
villa, or a house. This would be faceted by the state to get a state-wise analysis of people’s preferences.

8.In which year (2015, 2016 or 2017) were there the greatest average number of reviews for all the listings and to see the trend in
these three years if the number of reviews provided by customers has increased over time? Ideally a histogram would be plotted and faceted
by the property type to see the trends for each kind of property over the three years.
